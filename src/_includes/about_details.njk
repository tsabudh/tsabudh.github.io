            I&apos;m a full stack software engineer who ships scalable,
            production ready web apps. I build accessible, fast interfaces and
            well structured services with clear API contracts, solid tests, and
            useful observability.

            I also build accessible, high-performance interfaces with clear
            interaction flow and consistent component architecture. I design
            responsive layouts with predictable state, using transitions and
            animation to establish visual hierarchy and smooth navigation.
            Performance is improved through bundle trimming, asset optimization,
            targeted prefetching, and elimination of render bottlenecks via
            memoization and virtualization. I build reliable forms, robust
            real-time interactions, and consistent handling of error and empty
            states. Semantic markup and accessibility features ensure
            inclusivity, while design-system alignment and typed testing keep
            delivery fast and dependable.

            I design stateless APIs and scalable services with layered
            architectures that isolate business logic and support versioned
            contracts. I apply event-driven patterns and CQRS for decoupling,
            and model data with boundaries balancing normalization and
            consistency trade-offs. I manage backpressure through queues, flow
            control, and rate-aware consumers, and plan recovery with retries,
            idempotency, and compensating workflows. I work with relational and
            NoSQL databases, applying partitioning, replication, and indexing
            for performance. I tune systems by profiling, query optimization,
            and layered caching, and increase resilience through monitoring,
            tracing, failure testing, and progressive delivery.
